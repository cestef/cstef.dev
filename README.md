This is just my personal portfolio built using [`React`](https://reactjs.org) and [`Material-Ui`](https://mui.com)

## Installing

You can setup the project with your favorite package manager:

```
npm install
```

or
```
yarn
```

## Running locally

Again, use your favorite package manager to run the npm script:

```
npm start
```
or 
```
yarn start
```

## Building

This will produce a `build` directory containing the optimized code for production

```
npm run build
```

or 

```
yarn build
```

There is also the `build:deploy` script, but this one is mainly for my personal use, since I deploy on an [`Apache`](https://httpd.apache.org/) server.
