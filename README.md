# 👨‍💻 cstef.dev

My personal website, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

View it live at [cstef.dev](https://cstef.dev/).

## Development

I recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install the dependencies and run the scripts.

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```
You can then access the development server at the address displayed in the console. (or press <kbd>O</kbd> to open it in your default browser)

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
```

The build will be available in the `dist` folder.
