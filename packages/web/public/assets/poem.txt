In a world of fur and feline glee,	     	  	      	   	     
Dwelled some cats as silly as could be.      	     	     	    	       
With whiskers twitching, tails held high,	    	    	   
They made us laugh, oh my, oh my!	 		  	     	      
      	    	       	      	   	       	     	       	       	    
There was Whiskers, who wore a tiny hat,      	   	       	     	       
And danced on tables, imagine that!  	   	   	    	   	   
He'd twirl and spin, oh, such a show,    	      	  	      	     
Till he lost his hat and away it'd go.   	 

Then there was Mittens, the clumsy one,
Tripped on his paws, oh, what fun!
He'd chase his tail with endless delight,
In dizzy circles, day and night.

Fluffy, with a penchant for pouncing,
On shadows and dust, he was always bouncing.
Invisible foes, he'd boldly attack,
Then take a bow, and never look back.

Miss Prissy, the diva with a bow,
Would sashay around, to and fro.
Her elegance, an act to behold,
In her own world of silk and gold.

Tom and Jerry, a mischievous pair,
Played hide and seek, without a care.
They'd leap from cupboards, nook to nook,
Turning the house into a crazy nook.

Silly cats, each with their own flair,
A whisker twitch, a wild-eyed stare.
They made us laugh, our hearts they'd seize,
In a world of fur and endless cat capers, please!
